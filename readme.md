# Introduction to mRNA microarray

### About history

- Evolved from Southern blotting, which is a procedure to detect and quantify a specific DNA sequence. Microarray can be thought as parallelized Southern blotting.
- First influential paper: Schena *et al*. (1995) *Science* [study the expression of 45 Arabidopsis genes]
- mRNA microarray got 50,000+ hits on pubmed for the past 20 years
- Main pros: lower costs, easier experimental procedure and more established analysis methods

### About technology and design

![image-20181220093604849](https://github.com/reedliu/PicBed/blob/master/microarray/1.png)

- Collection of DNA spot on a solid surface
- Each spot contains many copies of the same DNA sequence ("probes")
  [probes are designed to target specific genes]
- Part of genes sequence are complementary to a probe ("hybridize" or "stick to")
- The amount of mRNA for target gene is measured with the amount of hybridization

### Platforms

- Affymetrix
- Agilent
- Nimblegene
- Illumina
- ABI
- Spotted cDNA

### Most famous - Affymetrix
